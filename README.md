## Stole my code please!

<div align="center">
      <td align="left">
        - I'm a professional slacker<br>
        - I code, but I don't know why I do that<br>
        - Currently, I'm doing something, but I also don't know what<br>
        - Learning C++ to continue my desperation<br>
        - Primarily using C# because I'm not good at C++
